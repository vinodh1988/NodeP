Every node application needs libraries and command line utilities
( compiler,test runner, linting tools,build tools

Both libraries and utilities are downloaded with help on npm

Libraries

		Libraries cab be categorized into two types
		
		   1. Production Dependencies
		     
		   2. Development Dependencies
		   
		   Ex:
		     Enzyme is a library used in react ,it is used for running tests but it is
			 in production...this is not necassary to be built in distributable copy
			 
			   such dependencies are development dependencies
			   
			 For Jquery  ,always jquery will be in the production code if it is used in 
			 developoment
			  
			    such dependencies are production dependencies
				
				
			To download production dependencies
			
			       npm install --save  <library name>
				   
				   in latest npm versions...
				   
				   npm install <library name>
				   
			to download development dependencies
			
			       npm install --save-dev <library name>
